# Question: What is a hybrid app?

### Answer:

Hybrid mobile apps can be installed on mobile devices, just like any other app. However, what makes hybrid apps different is that their main code is not installed natively onto the device itself; a webpage (that could have been originally designed for desktop use) is loaded directly in the hybrid application itself. 



*We now have the website-side of the "hybrid" concept down, what about the native part of the hybrid app?*

Although the denomination of the code which is installed locally can be arbitrary, there are different tasks suited for either storing code locally, or loading them as part of the website; the whole point of a hybrid app is to integrate the best of both worlds of native mobile apps, and the universality of webpages. 

An example of native code usage on hybrid apps can be better app-to-system communication, access to a device's hardware features (e.g. camera), and etc..



**The pros of a hybrid application:**

- Updates on the app store can take a long time for the verification process; a hybrid app of which its main contents that are hosted on a central database needs no update so long the modifications stay within the boundaries of the webpage. Updates of the app itself is only required if a modification of the native code is needed.
- Apps for IOS and Android are often written in different programming languages; and this can be a huge limitation and strain on our resources, as much of our effort will have to go towards adapting the app, rather than actually innovating. Meanwhile, a hybrid app bridges us over this obstacle, requiring us to only create the webpage part, and minimal work on the native code.
