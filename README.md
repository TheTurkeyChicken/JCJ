just a suggestion guys, but i think that it would be cool if we put each class's homework here



## Business Idea: Justin's

 I already have a Discord bot, and have experience with making one.

I believe that the Discord bot can be crucial to our project for this business initiative, however, I don't think a business relying solely on the bot can truly thrive. As a result, I think the bot can be a part of this business, playing a role in expanding our business through Discord.

As for the actual idea of the business itself, I really have no idea at the moment.
