Team repository as an experiment!



just a suggestion guys, but i think that it would be cool if we put each class's homework here



## Business Idea: Justin's

 I already have a Discord bot, and have experience with making one.

I believe that the Discord bot can be crucial to our project for this business initiative, however, I don't think a business relying solely on the bot can truly thrive. As a result, I think the bot can be a part of this business, playing a role in expanding our business through Discord.

As for the actual idea of the business itself, I really have no idea at the moment.

# Julia's App Ideas
1. Fitness tracker -> The user can enter their steps, calorie intake, calories burned and overall activity in order to maintained a balanced, and healthy lifestyle. Additionally, we can make it so that users can track their sleep, water intake, and wellbeing.
2. App for students where they can record tests, quizzes, and other important deadline dates. Additionally, it would be great to incorporate a schedule and a calculator where they can calculate their weighted averages, test scores, etc. themselves.
3. Package tracker -> where the user can enter their tracking numbers along with the packages that they've ordered from an array of different websites to have a more organized and clear knowledge of everything that's coming in the mail in order to avoid missing items.
4. An app for students where they can share their notes for different courses. This would allow users to have access to notes that other people have taken in order to help them with a particularly hard course. It is also a great way for users to interact and motivation to study hard.
# Julia's Business Ideas
1. Create a business to help make living more convienient and efficient.
2. Create a business to inform and alert others on specific news.
3. Create a business where people can interact with one another.

# Chris's business Ideas
1. An app that is essentially a group chat for students who can discuss classwork, and collaborate remotely

I think this would be great because from personal expirience this app would be extremely beneficial and helpful. Many students are struggling with work because they don't get enough help from teachers and peers, this app will solve that.
