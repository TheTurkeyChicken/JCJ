# Business Idea: Justin's

 I already have a Discord bot, and have experience with making one.

I believe that the Discord bot can be crucial to our project for this business initiative, however, I don't think a business relying solely on the bot can truly thrive. As a result, I think the bot can be a part of this business, playing a role in expanding our business through Discord.

As for the actual idea of the business itself, I really have no idea at the moment.

# Julia's App Ideas
1. Fitness tracker -> The user can enter their steps, calorie intake, calories burned and overall activity in order to maintained a balanced, and healthy lifestyle. Additionally, we can make it so that users can track their sleep, water intake, and wellbeing.
2. App for students where they can record tests, quizzes, and other important deadline dates. Additionally, it would be great to incorporate a schedule and a calculator where they can calculate their weighted averages, test scores, etc. themselves.
3. Package tracker -> where the user can enter their tracking numbers along with the packages that they've ordered from an array of different websites to have a more organized and clear knowledge of everything that's coming in the mail in order to avoid missing items.
4. An app for students where they can share their notes for different courses. This would allow users to have access to notes that other people have taken in order to help them with a particularly hard course. It is also a great way for users to interact and motivation to study hard.
# Julia's Business Ideas
1. Create a business to help make living more convienient and efficient.
2. Create a business to inform and alert others on specific news.
3. Create a business where people can interact with one another.

# Chris's business Ideas
1. An app that is essentially a group chat for students who can discuss classwork, and collaborate remotely

I think this would be great because from personal expirience this app would be extremely beneficial and helpful. Many students are struggling with work because they don't get enough help from teachers and peers, this app will solve that.



# Julia's Actions:

Research on interested topics that combine #2 & #4. Do market research (audience, users). 


If there are already competitor apps/websites doing similar jobs, recognize them.

There are of course existig competitors who do similar tasks as what we want to accomplish such as Fiveable, Google Docs, etc. The difference that we want to make is that it is going to be an independent app where anyone can share their notes and not just the 'teachers' or people qualified. Additionally, anyone can view it as well, unlike Google Drive where it is access limited to only a link. Lastly, our app provides a good communication source because users are allowed to post comments and text each other.

How would we generate revenue from our app?

When we get bigger, we can incorporate ads into the website. The more users we get, the more revenue we generate. We can have subscriptions and sponsorships where people pay money monthly and are able to premium features such as access to prestigious professors' notes, study packs, tips, etc.

# Justin's Actions:

What will the app look like? Website? Mobile App? Both? Target? Research on the media that the customers use.

- For website:
  - Perhaps a website would be a better way to kickstart the app, as it would be more straightforward to create
  - There would not be a hassle to learn all of the issues that may come with compatibility with IOS
  - Less hassle: will not have to be enrolled in Apple's Developer Program, will not have to undergo an app certification process, and follow other guidelines that comes with publishing an app.
  - Less to worry about in general
- For app:
  - Will not need a strong central database for idea #2
  - Some people will prefer using apps on their phones instead of websites on their computers.

- I asked in my grade's Discord what medium they would prefer for a scheduling app:
  - Most people answered that they preferred using a website, however, this inclination may be misleading.
  - WPGA (my school) in the last year banned all Grade 8-9's from using phones at any time during school hours.
  - Though my school and my grade in particular may prefer using computers for a website, this may be an isolated case.
- With those points in mind, I believe that the best course of action is to kickstart divvynotes with creating first, a working and stable website, which would be mostly free of the hassles that comes with developing mobile apps. After that, perhaps we could extend further and open the windows to mobile users as well.



# Chris' Actions:

What database will we use to build this app? Choose ones that are specific to the media/devices.

- website
  - most likely we will need a database to store user accounts and other information
  - we can use a SQL server to do this:
    - https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/sql-server/sql-server-downloads
    
    - we will set up the server on someones computer

    - we will make some sort of array or table to store information (it will look something like this):
    
    - (this comment is from justin: having worked with a discord bot before which stores data, you really need a userid that comes in the form of a number, which has nothing to do with the front-end, but this would make work on the back-end so much easier)

      -------------------------------------------------------------------
  - for the back-end coding we have muliple options such as:
    - PHP
    - JavaScript
    - React.js
    - Python
    - HTML
  - I believe that we all have a little bit of expirience with these languages so when we start coding we should be comfortable
  
  (side thought: I think we should split the coding evenly amongst the 3 of us so we can do as much work as possible and then we can troubleshoot each others code)
  
  I agree with justin that we should be using a website first then transitioning to apps because website are available on almost all platforms. Phones, laptops and sometimes even smart tv's. Website will allow us to expand our business the most.
  
  If use HTML, we can style our website with CSS and make it look very aesthetic and clean. Something like this will make the website more attractive:

  - Overall there are many options we can choose to build our website but we should keep it simple and stupid.
